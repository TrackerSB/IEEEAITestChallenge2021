## Submission requirements for Deliverable #2:

- [x] Scenarios and associated scripts
- [x] Simulation execution report including selected representative classified executive simulation scenarios and corresponding scripts. For each classified scenario, include only 3-5 representative samples (With SVL Simulator 2021.1, a report is generated by enabling the Create Test Report option, printing the resulting Test Results screen as a PDF and including that report.)
- [x] Scenario demo videos(e.g. screen capture video; submit link to YouTube, Google Drive, etc.)
- [x] Selected scenario trip/route and map information (e.g. which maps were used; include descriptions and/or sketches of routes for ego and NPC trajectories)
- [x] A (written) simulation test report, which documents the generated test scenarios, classes, scripting methods, simulation test coverage, and problem findings.
- [ ] A slides deck presenting the scenarios included in Deliverable #2. For each scenario:
* Briefly explain what it does
* Embed videos(s) to show the representative testing results of the scenario
* Explain how you maximize the variety of the scenario
* Show the AV problems (if any) found in the scenario
* Include any other useful information about the scenario for the judges to understand the scenario
