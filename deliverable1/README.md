## General approach to testing

### Our experience
Our team did already a range of papers and thesis in the fields of testing autonomous cars in simulations, automatically generating test scenarios for autonomous cars and providing a platform for running those tests.

\<TODO\>

#### DriveBuild ([see &rArr;](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/341110007_DriveBuild_Automation_of_Simulation-based_Testing_of_Autonomous_Vehicles))
DriveBulid is a platform for:
 - running and distributing simulations testing autonomous cars over a network
 - connecting custom test generators and AIs over a tiny and thus simple interface
 - describing maps and test oracles in a straight forward, easy to understand and yet powerful XML format
 - automatically generating maps based on the XML description
 - collecting varios data for justifying the quality of test generators and AIs in a big data manner

#### Even more papers...
